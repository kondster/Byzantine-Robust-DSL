Now, you can execute the `cb_dsl.py` script with different arguments and parameters. Here are a few examples:

1. Run the script with default settings:
   ```
   python cb_dsl.py
   ```

2. Run the script with a different number of workers and rounds:
   ```
   python cb_dsl.py --num_workers 10 --num_rounds 20
   ```

3. Run the script with a different batch size and learning rate:
   ```
   python cb_dsl.py --batch_size 256 --learning_rate 0.01
   ```

4. Run the script with non-IID data partitioning:
   ```
   python cb_dsl.py --non_iid
   ```

5. Run the script with Byzantine attack simulation:
   ```
   python cb_dsl.py --attack_scenario
   ```

You can combine multiple arguments as needed. The script will use the provided arguments to configure the CB-DSL algorithm and run accordingly.

Feel free to adjust the arguments and their default values based on your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions!
